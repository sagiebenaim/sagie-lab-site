I am an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) and an [Amazon Scholar](https://www.amazon.science/scholars). I'm honored to be a 2024 Alon Scholarship Recipient. Previously, I was a postdoc at [DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/english/) working with Prof. [Serge Belongie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergebelongie/?originalSubdomain=dk) and a member of the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://di.ku.dk/ai-centre). Before that, I completed my PhD at Tel Aviv University, working in the Deep Learning Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/).

At the Hebrew University, I lead a computer vision group focused on 3D and generative AI. In particular, we aim to find efficient methods for reconstructing, generating, and understanding the dynamic 3D world. To this end, we use tools from computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics. 

**For Prospective Students:**
I am always seeking excellent students and postdocs. If you are interested, please contact me! As an ELLIS Scholar, I also welcome applications through the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).
